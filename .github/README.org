** Nix
The "Textbook" Definition - A Linux distribution based on the Nix package manager and guided by Nix's core principles.

NixOS is a unique distro. Unlike other distros where you store your configurations in `~/.config/` and binaries in `~/.local/bin` , nix takes a different approach. Instead you can [[https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/declarative][declaratively]] define your configuration in `.nix` files. These nix files can be used to install and configure programs, services, setting up things like xresources, etc. This approach provides a modular system that enables users to share, reuse, and modify their configurations easily.

*** So, should I use nix?
I'm going to go against the grain here and say; yes! If you find NixOS interesting, go ahead and try it out! You can always just reinstall arch if it's too hard :D. Seriously, though, it seems like every Nix user in existence doesn't want new Nix users. I just started out on my Nix journey, so my opinions may very well change, but in my opinion, nix isn't difficult; it's just different. You will have a hard time at first, but it will get substantially easier as you go along, and soon it may be hard to go back. So my answer is yes; go ahead and try Nix out. Just make sure you set your root password before you reboot out of the chroot.

** Installation
Don't blindly follow these instructions. They're here more as a personal note than anything.

Follow the [[https://github.com/tpwrules/nixos-apple-silicon/blob/main/docs/uefi-standalone.md][nixos-apple-silicon]] guide to install asahi, uboot, and m1n1 to your machine. Reboot your machine into NixOS and login as root.

Run the following commands:

1. Clone dotfiles:

#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/aspectsides/dotfiles /etc/nixos
cd /etc/nixos
#+end_src


2. Enable flakes

#+begin_src sh
nix-shell -p nixFlakes
#+end_src

3. Rebuild system from flake

#+begin_src sh
nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#starfall
#+end_src

** Todo
somethings i need to do before i can call my config fully usable
- [ ] Lockscreen with swaylock
- [ ] lf icons and trash-cli integration
- [x] Firefox user.js
- [x] nvim managed with nix
